# Java Bootcamp: Day 03 - Threads

## Overview
On Day 03, participants are introduced to Java's multithreading mechanisms, learning to write programs that perform multiple operations simultaneously.

## Tasks

### Exercise 00: Egg, Hen... or Human?
- **Objective**: Implement two threads that output their messages a specified number of times, followed by the main thread's output.
- **Directory**: `ex00`
- **Files**: `*.java`
- **Key Concepts**: Basic thread creation and execution

### Exercise 01: Egg, Hen, Egg, Hen...
- **Objective**: Coordinate two threads to alternate their messages in a synchronized manner.
- **Directory**: `ex01`
- **Files**: `*.java`
- **Key Concepts**: Thread synchronization, Producer-Consumer model

### Exercise 02: Real Multithreading
- **Objective**: Use multithreading to calculate the sum of an array's elements, with each thread processing a section of the array.
- **Directory**: `ex02`
- **Files**: `*.java`
- **Key Concepts**: Thread management, parallel computation

### Exercise 03: Too Many Threads...
- **Objective**: Implement a multithreaded file downloader that manages a pool of threads to download a list of files from the network.
- **Directory**: `ex03`
- **Files**: `*.java`, `files_urls.txt`
- **Key Concepts**: Thread pooling, network I/O
